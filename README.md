#### Brackey's World

Brackey's World is a small game made as my personal extension to  [Brackey's](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys/featured) [Godot Beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=8s). My goal with this project is to create a handful of new levels, enemies, and features - expand my knowledge and experience in the Godot engine and the overall art of Game Development.
